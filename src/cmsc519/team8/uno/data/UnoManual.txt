UNO Help Manual

** HOW TO PLAY **

i. The objective of "Uno" is to reduce your hand to zero before your opponents can do so.

1. Every player picks a card. The person who picks the highest number deals. Action Cards 
count as zero for this part of the game. 

2. Once the cards are shuffled each player is dealt 7 cards. 
The remainder of the deck is placed face down to form a DRAW pile. 

3. The top card of the DRAW pile is turned over to begin a DISCARD pile. 
If an Action Card is the first one turned up from the DRAW pile, 
it needs to be placed back to DRAW pile (any place other than the top). 
Repeat 3 until the top card of the DRAW pile is not an action card. 

4. The person to the left of the dealer starts play. 
He/she has to match the card on the DISCARD pile, either by number, color or symbol. 
For example, if the card is a red 7, the player must put down a red card or any color 7. 
Alternatively, the player can put down a Wild card.

**THE WILD CARD **

The "Wild Card" can be played upon any other card, at which point the player calls a color,
the color of the wild card becomes the declard color, and the following card's color must
match it to be legally played. Note that no other card can match the wild card's number since
it does not have one, so the only cards that can be played immediately after a Wild Card is a
card of the declared color.

** ENDING THE GAME **
Before the draw pile is empty, when a player has only one card left, he/she must yell "UNO" 
(meaning "one"). Once a player has no card left, the game ends. 
If the draw pile is empty, the person who holds the least number of cards wins.
